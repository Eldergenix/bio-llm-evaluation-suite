# Design Documents

This directory houses architecture and experimentation plans for flagship projects.

- `bio-llm-eval.md` — forthcoming design for the Bio-LLM Evaluation Suite (model selection, dataset curation, safety guardrails).
- `vla-lab-robotics.md` — upcoming plan for the vision-language-action lab robotics controller.
- `comparative-agentic-platform.md` — integration strategy for Galaxy workflows + Cognitive Kernel-Pro agents.

Each design document should cover objectives, background, system architecture, experiment plan, evaluation metrics, risks, and implementation timeline. Include traceable links back to issues on the public project board.
