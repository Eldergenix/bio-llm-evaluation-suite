# Dataset Backlog Candidates (Q4 2025)

| Dataset | Domain | License | Potential Use | Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MIMIC-IV (de-identified) | Clinical notes, labs | PhysioNet usage agreement | Advanced privacy leakage probes, multi-task evaluation | Assess licensing + IRB requirements; plan PHI scans |
| BioASQ QA | Biomedical QA | Creative Commons | Benchmark multi-hop QA and reasoning | Draft dataset request issue; align with Kernel-Pro maintainers |
| PMC-Patients | Patient-friendly summaries | CC BY 4.0 | Lay summarisation + communication safety | Evaluate overlap with BioLaySumm; check data volume |
| LitCovid | COVID-19 literature | CC BY 4.0 | Domain adaptation, trend analysis | Determine if still relevant; consider for longitudinal studies |
| Pathology Reports (TCGA subset) | Histopathology text | TCGA data use agreement | Multi-modal integration (future vision-language work) | Confirm access rights; note for 2026 roadmap |

## Actions

1. Open dataset onboarding issues using the new template for top two candidates (MIMIC-IV, BioASQ).  
2. Coordinate with compliance/legal on MIMIC-IV requirements.  
3. Add backlog cards to project board (`contrib::dataset` label) and link to this file.  
4. Reassess Q4 scope after first fine-tuning run metrics.
