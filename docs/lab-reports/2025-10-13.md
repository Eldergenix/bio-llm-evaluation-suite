# Lab Report — 2025-10-13 → 2025-10-19

**Prepared By:** @nexisdev  
**Focus Areas:** AI Research, Bio-AI, Computational Biology

## 1. High-Impact Contributions

- Repository scaffolding for AI/Bio research portfolio (README, templates, outreach drafts, design doc).  
  - Purpose: Establish public-facing hub communicating competencies and roadmap.  
  - Evidence: `README.md`, `templates/`, `docs/designs/bio-llm-eval.md`.

## 2. Experiments & Findings

| Experiment | Objective | Dataset / Environment | Outcome | Follow-up |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| N/A | Kickoff week (planning & scaffolding). | Local workspace | Planning groundwork laid. | Begin dataset audits next week. |

## 3. Open Source Contributions in Flight

- Galaxy Project: drafting outreach template, identifying GPU acceleration opportunities.  
- MAIA: prepared deployment-focused outreach template.  
- Cognitive Kernel-Pro: prepared evaluation-focused outreach template.

## 4. Communication & Community Engagement

- Outreach templates ready for maintainers (Galaxy, MAIA, Cognitive Kernel-Pro).  
- Profile README drafted to align messaging for upcoming introductions.
- Blog outline drafted for first full fine-tuning run; integrating CI automation and LoRA updates for forthcoming communication.

## 5. Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Lack of maintainer alignment delaying contribution onboarding.  
  - *Mitigation:* Send outreach messages early week, propose design docs, request review slots.
- **Risk:** Limited visibility without demos.  
  - *Mitigation:* Schedule demo recordings once prototypes exist; plan for YouTube/README embeds.

## 6. Next Week’s Commitments

1. Send outreach emails to target maintainers and follow up within 3 business days.  
2. Scope dataset compliance checklist for Bio-LLM Evaluation Suite.  
3. Draft public project board structure (issues + labels).  
4. Prepare first contribution issue drafts for Galaxy and Cognitive Kernel-Pro.  
5. Update changelog with outreach status and design progress.  
6. Finalise full-run proposal and circulate to infra/compliance for approvals.
