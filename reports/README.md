# Reports Directory

Generated metrics and evaluation reports from the Bio-LLM Evaluation Suite are stored here.

- `pubmedqa-baseline.json` — Output of the dry-run baseline config.
- `artifacts/` — Training artefacts (checkpoints, metrics) defined per config.

Add report summaries to the changelog once evaluations run on real datasets.
