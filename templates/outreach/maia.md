# Outreach: MAIA Platform Maintainers

**Subject:** Helm Chart & HIPAA-Aligned Pipeline Contributions for MAIA

Hi <Maintainer Name>,

I’m Nexis (@nexisdev), working at the intersection of AI research and clinical deployment. I’m planning Q4 open-source contributions and would love to collaborate with the MAIA community on deployment and compliance tooling.

**Initial Contribution Plan**
- Author production-ready Helm charts to simplify MAIA deployments in U.S. hospital clusters (EKS/GKE/AKS targets).
- Document HIPAA-aligned data ingestion pipelines, including audit logging, PHI de-identification, and access controls.
- Help co-lead an upcoming sprint on clinician feedback loops to ensure ML updates stay aligned with clinical workflows.

Could you point me toward:
1. Current deployment pain points or roadmap items I can assist with.
2. Any regulatory/compliance guidelines MAIA contributors should follow.
3. Preferred communication channels (Slack/Matrix) and sprint cadences.

I can begin drafting design docs the week of 13 Oct 2025. Let me know if a quick sync would help align on priorities.

Appreciate the guidance and looking forward to contributing!

Best,
