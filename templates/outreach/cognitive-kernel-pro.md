# Outreach: Cognitive Kernel-Pro Maintainers

**Subject:** Extending Biomedical Reasoning & Evaluation Suites for Cognitive Kernel-Pro

Hi <Maintainer Name>,

I’m Nexis (@nexisdev). I’m aligning my Q4 open-source roadmap with projects pushing the boundaries of agentic research systems, and Cognitive Kernel-Pro is a perfect fit.

**Proposed Contributions**
- Implement biomedical reasoning tasks (PubMedQA, BioLaySumm, ClinSum) leveraging Kernel-Pro agents with reflection support.
- Build a GAIA-style evaluation suite tailored for biomedical benchmarks, including automatic metric aggregation and qualitative trace review.
- Draft a technical note on agent reflection patterns for domain-specific research, potentially as a joint blog or whitepaper.

It would be helpful to learn:
1. Which biomedical or domain-specific tasks are currently underserved in the project.
2. Preferred testing environments and datasets for new evaluation suites.
3. Opportunities to participate in community calls or roadmap discussions.

I’m ready to start designing the evaluation harness the week of 13 Oct 2025 and can share progress updates every Friday.

Thanks for the leadership on Kernel-Pro—excited to collaborate.

Best,
