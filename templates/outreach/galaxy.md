# Outreach: Galaxy Project Maintainers

**Subject:** Proposal: GPU-Accelerated Genomics Tools for Galaxy 24.2

Hi <Maintainer Name>,

I’m Nexis (GitHub: @nexisdev), focusing on AI-driven computational biology. I’m scoping Q4 contributions and would like to collaborate on GPU-accelerated genomics workflows for the upcoming 24.2 release.

**Contribution Ideas**
- Port existing CPU pipelines (e.g., variant calling, read alignment) to GPU-backed Galaxy tools using CUDA/OpenCL.
- Publish reproducible Jupyter tutorials that demonstrate workflow speedups and validation against baseline outputs.
- Co-author a blog post with the Galaxy team on reproducibility and hardware acceleration.

I’d appreciate your guidance on:
1. Active issues or milestones where GPU acceleration would be most impactful.
2. Preferred review process (branching, CI expectations, testing datasets).
3. Opportunities to join sprint meetings or working groups.

I can dedicate 10–12 hours per week starting the week of 13 Oct 2025 and am happy to draft a detailed design doc once we align.

Thanks for your time—looking forward to supporting the Galaxy community.

Best,
