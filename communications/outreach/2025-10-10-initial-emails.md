## Galaxy Project — Helena Rasche

**To:** helena.rasche@galaxyproject.org (placeholder — confirm current contact)  
**Subject:** GPU Acceleration Proposal for Galaxy 24.2 Workflows

Hi Helena,

I’m Nexis (GitHub: @nexisdev). I’ve been following your work on the Galaxy Training Network and the broader Galaxy Project leadership, especially around scaling the platform for bioinformatics researchers. I’m preparing Q4 contributions focused on GPU acceleration for clinical genomics workflows and would love to collaborate with you and the team.

**What I’d like to deliver in the Galaxy 24.2 cycle**
- Port high-demand alignment tools (starting with `bwa_mem`) to GPU backends, leveraging CUDA/Clara Parabricks where appropriate.
- Provide reproducible notebooks and workflow history comparisons showing runtime improvements and validation vs. CPU baselines.
- Co-author a short post on reproducibility considerations for accelerated workflows so users understand hardware requirements and fallbacks.

Could you advise on:
1. Existing GPU tooling efforts I should align with (or avoid duplicating).
2. Preferred review process and CI expectations for GPU-dependent tools.
3. Opportunities to join sprint calls or the GTN working sessions over the next month.

I can commit 10–12 hours per week starting 13 Oct 2025 and can share a design brief within a week of aligning.

Thanks for all the work you do for the Galaxy community—looking forward to collaborating.

Best,

## MAIA Platform — Simone Bendazzoli

**To:** simone.bendazzoli@polimi.it (placeholder — confirm preferred email)  
**Subject:** Helm Chart & HIPAA Deployment Contributions for MAIA

Hi Simone,

Congratulations on the MAIA platform work—your recent arXiv release outlining the collaborative medical-AI stack was a great read. I’m mapping my Q4 open-source contributions to highlight safety and deployment rigour, and MAIA’s focus on clinician-aligned workflows really resonates.

I’d like to help by:
- Authoring production-grade Helm charts to simplify MAIA deployments on EKS/GKE/AKS clusters used by U.S. hospital systems.
- Documenting HIPAA-aligned ingestion pipelines (audit logging, de-identification hooks, access controls) that teams can adopt out-of-the-box.
- Co-facilitating a sprint on clinician feedback loops so model updates remain tethered to real-world feedback.

Would you be open to a quick sync to discuss roadmap priorities? Specifically, I’m curious about:
1. Current deployment pain points or infrastructure debt the team wants help with.
2. Compliance guidance I should follow as an external contributor.
3. Standing meetings or community channels I should join to stay aligned.

I can provide a draft architecture document by 18 Oct 2025 and iterate based on your feedback.

Appreciate your time and looking forward to supporting MAIA.

Best,

## Cognitive Kernel-Pro — Hongming Zhang

**To:** hongming.zhang@tencent.com (placeholder — confirm current contact)  
**Subject:** Biomedical Evaluation Harness for Cognitive Kernel-Pro

Hi Hongming,

I’m Nexis (@nexisdev) and have been studying Cognitive Kernel-Pro since the INTELLECT-3 framework note—exciting progress on collaborative research agents. I’m planning a Q4 contribution pushing Kernel-Pro toward biomedical reasoning workloads, and I’d value your guidance.

Proposed work:
- Build a GAIA-style biomedical evaluation suite covering PubMedQA, BioLaySumm, and MultiClinSum benchmarks with automated scoring and safety checks.
- Add reflection logging so researchers can inspect agent reasoning traces alongside quantitative metrics.
- Publish a short technical note (or shared blog) on lessons learned when adapting Kernel-Pro to regulated biomedical use cases.

Could we coordinate on:
1. The best entry point in the repo for extending evaluation configs.
2. Any preferred hosting of benchmark datasets or licensing considerations.
3. Opportunities to join community calls or Slack/Discord channels to keep the work visible.

I’m ready to start iterating on configs the week of 13 Oct 2025 and can share weekly progress notes.

Thanks for building such a flexible research platform—I’m excited to contribute.

Best,
