# Outreach Follow-Ups — Week of 2025-10-15

## Galaxy Project — Helena Rasche

Subject: Update: GPU acceleration timeline + first run plan

Hi Helena,

Quick follow-up on the GPU acceleration proposal: we now have a concrete plan to run the LoRA fine-tunes between 27 Oct and 8 Nov (proposal: `docs/proposals/bio-llm-full-run.md`). Budget approval is in progress, and the first PR will focus on `bwa_mem` acceleration plus reproducible benchmarking notebooks.

Would you have 20 minutes the week of 21 Oct to review the design doc and pick the best target tool? Happy to adapt scope based on Galaxy roadmap priorities.

Best,
Nexis

## MAIA — Simone Bendazzoli

Subject: MAIA deployment charts + Bio-LLM evaluation results window

Hi Simone,

Sharing a quick update: we are targeting 27 Oct – 8 Nov for the first full Bio-LLM fine-tuning run (proposal attached). Once metrics land, I plan to integrate MAIA deployment artefacts (Helm charts + HIPAA checklist) and share combined learnings in early November.

Could we schedule a sync in the week of 28 Oct to walk through deployment expectations and clinician feedback loops? I’d also love your input on the compliance checklist before we publish it.

Thanks,
Nexis

## Cognitive Kernel-Pro — Hongming Zhang

Subject: Biomedical evaluation suite + timeline for first metrics

Hi Hongming,

Thanks again for keeping Kernel-Pro open and extensible. We now have the LoRA-ready pipeline and are planning a full run 27 Oct – 8 Nov (proposal details enclosed). The evaluation suite will log accuracy, toxicity, and privacy heuristics; next iteration adds richer safety probes.

I’d appreciate a chance to validate the GAIA-style configuration with you or the team before the run—do you have availability late October? After the run, we’ll share metrics and a short technical note as discussed.

Best,
Nexis
